0.7.0:
    - Added shortify.com, 0rz.net
    - Modified unit tests
    - Started using CVS on RubyForge

0.6.0:
    - Changed the method for getting the URL for ln-s.net to use their
      API.  So basically, this means the new additional argument attribute
      in the Service class is now useless, because no service uses it.  I've
      removed it along with the Hash#to_html_args method.
    - Added d62.net, shiturl.com, littlink.com and clipurl.com

0.5.0:
    - Added two services: fyad.org and ln-s.net (thanks to Daniel
      Dipaolo)
    - Added an property to the Service class: args.  This allows to give
      additional arguments to services using the GET method (this was
      needed by ln-s.net)
    - Added a method to Hash to convert to an HTML arguments style
    - Added a script called "shorturl" (duh) in the bin directory for
      usage from the command line.

0.4.0:
    - Added minilink.org
    - More tests for the Service class
    - Changed the ArgumentError exception for an InvalidService exception in ShortURL.shorten
    - Created examples/shorten.rb
    - Added a stats task to the Rakefile.  Requires code_statistics, provided by Rails.
